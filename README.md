TENSOR FLOW:
TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. TensorFlow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming. We are using Faster RCNN algorithm for pest and disease detection.
3.5.4.1 FASTER RCNN ALGORITHM:
Faster RCNN is an object detector that was developed solely by Ross Girshick, a Facebook AI researcher and a former Microsoft Researcher. Fast R-CNN overcomes several issues in R-CNN. As its name suggests, one advantage of the Fast R-CNN over R-CNN is its speed.
